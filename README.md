Welcome to the hipaa repository. This project provides a HIPAA and GDPR compliant, ready-to-run parse-server setup that works with PostgreSQL or MongoDB. It includes a modern admin dashboard (parse-hipaa-dashboard) and is designed to be compatible with ParseCareKit. The goal is to give developers a solid base for building BaaS apps that handle sensitive health data with strong governance and clear data flows.

Key ideas
- A secure Parse Server core that can store data in PostgreSQL or MongoDB.
- A HIPAA-ready dashboard for governance, auditing, and user access control.
- A smooth pathway to include ParseCareKit integrations.
- Thorough guidance for deployment in Docker, cloud, or on-prem environments.

Why this project matters
- HIPAA and GDPR demand strict controls on data access, auditing, encryption, and data lineage.
- A ready-to-run platform helps teams accelerate compliant health apps while reducing boilerplate work.
- The design favors clear data boundaries, explicit access rules, and observable behavior.

Embracing the topics that drive this project
- backend-as-a-service, carekit, cloud, docker, gdqr, graphql, mbaas, mongodb, parse-dashboard, postgre, singularity

Overview of the project
- Core: A Parse Server instance configured to use either PostgreSQL or MongoDB as the primary data store. It includes hooks and policies to help enforce privacy and security requirements.
- Admin: A web-based dashboard named parse-hipaa-dashboard. It provides roles, permissions, data access request management, and activity auditing.
- API surface: A GraphQL layer (where applicable) to enable flexible queries and efficient data access patterns.
- Compliance layer: Features to support HIPAA and GDPR obligations. Examples include access controls, audit trails, data export, and secure data handling.

Quick start

A pragmatic path to a running instance
- Prerequisites
  - Docker or Docker Compose installed on your host
  - Access to a PostgreSQL or MongoDB server
  - Node.js is optional for local development, but Docker is recommended for first run

- Single-node quick start (Docker)
  - Create a simple docker-compose.yml that wires Parse Server to a database and the dashboard to the server.
  - Bring up the stack and wait for the services to become healthy.

- Multi-node patterns
  - Use a managed PostgreSQL or MongoDB service in the cloud for production deployments.
  - Run Parse Server and the dashboard as separate services for scalability and isolation.

- Basic workflow
  - Start services
  - Create an admin user for the dashboard
  - Connect a client app to the Parse Server
  - Verify that operations on PHI data are logged and auditable

Sample docker-compose snippet
- This is a minimal, illustrative example to help you get started. Adjust environment variables and volumes to fit your environment.

  postgres:
    image: postgres:15
    container_name: hipaa-postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: hipaa
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: securePass123
      POSTGRES_DB: hipaa
    volumes:
      - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  mongodb:
    image: mongo:6
    container_name: hipaa-mongo
    volumes:
      - mongo-data:/data/db

If you want a guided, production-grade setup, consult the documentation in the repository and tweak the compose file to add:
- TLS termination for Parse Server and the dashboard
- Separate persistence for logs and audit trails
- Secrets management for credentials
- Health checks and restart policies

Architecture and design

High-level view
- Parse Server core
  - Database adapters: PostgreSQL and MongoDB

  - Cloud Code (server-side logic) support
- GraphQL layer (optional)
  - A GraphQL gateway that surfaces common read patterns and reduces the risk of overexposure
- Admin dashboard (parse-hipaa-dashboard)
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Data access requests (DAR) workflow
  - Audit trails and event logging
  - Export and data minimization tools
- Compliance and security features
  - Encryption at rest (leveraged by underlying databases)
  - TLS in transit
  - Fine-grained access controls for PHI
  - Auditable changes and immutable logs
- CareKit compatibility

  - Sync patterns that ease integration with care coordination apps

Key components in detail
- Parse Server core
  - Modular design to swap out the database adapter without large rewrites
  - Hooks and triggers for data access, validation, and privacy checks
  - Webhooks for external systems and care workflows
- Admin dashboard (parse-hipaa-dashboard)
  - Graphical interface for managing users, roles, and permissions
  - Workflows for approving access requests to PHI
  - Dashboarding that reveals who accessed what data and when

  - Audit logging that covers reads, writes, and administrative actions
- API surface
  - REST/Parse Server endpoints for mobile and web apps
  - Optional GraphQL layer to support advanced querying
  - Clear separation between app data and meta data

Data models and privacy controls

Foundational data governance
- PHI and PII handling
  - Sensitive fields are treated with extra care. Access to PHI is logged and constrained by roles.
  - Data masking strategies for user interfaces when full PHI is not needed.
- Access control model
  - Roles: admin, clinician, researcher, data subject, auditor
  - Permissions: read, write, delete, export, grant-access, revoke-access
  - Data subjects can request data access or deletion under policy
- Auditing and logging
  - Every create, read, update, delete (CRUD) operation is recorded with a timestamp and actor
  - Logs are stored in an auditable store and can be exported to a secure SIEM if needed
- Data export and deletion
  - Subject Access Requests (SAR) can be fulfilled with a portable export
  - Data deletion respects retention policies and ensures traceability of deletions
- Encryption and key management
  - Data at rest relies on database-level encryption features
  - Data in transit uses TLS and secure certificates
  - Key management strategies for rotating keys and revoking access

Deployment patterns

Docker and container-first deployment
- Build and run
  - Use the provided Docker images for Parse Server and dashboard

  - Use environment variables to configure database connections and keys
- Compose-based orchestration
  - A single docker-compose.yml can stand up the stack for development and testing
  - For production, split services into separate stacks and add TLS, secrets, and monitoring

Cloud-native deployment
- Kubernetes
  - Deploy Parse Server as a Deployment or StatefulSet
  - Use a managed database service for PostgreSQL or MongoDB
  - Ingress/TLS termination for external access
  - RBAC and network policies to enforce least privilege
- Serverless and managed services
  - Use managed databases and app runners to reduce maintenance overhead
  - Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployments

Development patterns

Local development

- Validate that access controls work as intended and that audit logs capture all actions

Testing and quality
- Unit tests for core business logic
- Integration tests for database adapters
- End-to-end tests covering user flows in the dashboard and data access requests
- Linting and style checks to keep code readable and consistent

Observability and monitoring

What to monitor
- Event rate and API latency
